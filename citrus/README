Issues:
=========================
1. Using ~/root/.pulp/user-cert.pem for REST call to upstream.
   Need something better.

2. How to deal with repo scratchpad.
   - Not supported by REST API.
   - Does not seem to be an issue though.

3. How to deal with coupling between importer/distributer
   via scratchpad.
     - yum importer uses scratchpad to communicate working_directory
       containing YUM metadata.
     - Does not seem to be an issue though.

4. Need to deal with different root directories
   used for storage_path(s) on Units.  Differences in upstream & downstream
   server configuration as it pertains to this.

5. Need to clean up orphaned units (packages).



PUBLISHING:
===================
>>> import pic
>>> pic.connect()
>>> pic.POST('v2/repositories/<repo_id>/actions/publish/', dict(id='pulp_distributor'))

note: REST doc needs to specify (id) parameter.
